<h3> Favorite Volleyball Moments </h3>
    <ul>
  <li>One of my favorite volleyball memories is last year at one of the biggest tournamnets, my friend dove into a row a chairs and got stuck, and mid game I had to walk over and pull her out of the chairs so we could keep playing.</li>
  <li>I throughly enjoy going to LOVB volleyball games with my teammates.</li>
  <li>One of the coolest things that my team and I got to do is personally meet some of the LOVB volleyball players, and getting to know them personally.</li>
</ul>
		 <h3> Favorite Volleyball Teams </h3>
    <ul>
  <li>One of my favorite volleyball teams is the Utah Womens Professional Team, better known as LOVB Volleyball. Many people who like here in Salt Lake don't know we have this team. But they pretty good. Many of the players have played in the Olympics. I think its really cool to see them play</li>
  <li>Another team I enjoy watching is UCLA's Vollage Volleyball team. I prefer watching teams that were in the Pac12. Even though that isn't a thing anymore.</li>
  <li>I enjoy watching womens collage sports in preticular. I find it really fun and I often watch the games with my mom. </li>
</ul>
		<h3> Favorite Volleyball Tournaments </h3>

  <li>Nationals - Orlando, Florida</li>
  <li>Colorado Crossroads - Denver, Colorado</li>
